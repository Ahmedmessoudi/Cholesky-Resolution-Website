# Cholesky Resolution Website

Welcome to the **Cholesky Resolution Website**! This interactive project allows users to explore the Cholesky decomposition method using three types of matrices: **Dense**, **Banded**, and **Diagonal**. It is built with a modern tech stack, leveraging **React** for the frontend and **Flask** for the backend.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Interactive User Experience**: Engage with a user-friendly interface to input and manipulate matrices.
- **Matrix Support**:
  - **Dense Matrices**: Full matrices with non-zero elements throughout.
  - **Banded Matrices**: Sparse matrices with non-zero elements concentrated around the diagonal.
  - **Diagonal Matrices**: Matrices with non-zero elements only on the main diagonal.
- **Real-time Feedback**: Visualize and understand the Cholesky decomposition step by step.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Frontend
- **React**: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **CSS/Styled Components**: To enhance the visual appeal and ensure a seamless user experience.

### Backend
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework to handle matrix computations and serve the API.
- **NumPy**: For efficient numerical computations and matrix manipulations.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js**: For running the React application.
- **Python**: For running the Flask backend.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cholesky-resolution-website.git
   cd cholesky-resolution-website
   ```

2. Set up the backend:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app.py
   ```

3. Set up the frontend:
   ```bash
   cd ../frontend
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## 💡 Usage
1. Select the type of matrix you want to work with (Dense, Banded, or Diagonal).
2. Input your matrix dimensions and elements.
3. View the step-by-step Cholesky decomposition process.
4. Analyze the results interactively.

## 📈 Future Improvements
- Add support for sparse matrices.
- Enhance performance for larger matrices.
- Integrate tutorials or guides on Cholesky decomposition.
- Deploy the project online for global access.
